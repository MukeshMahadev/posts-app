üöÄ About This Project

This project is a FastAPI application that showcases a modern, scalable web service built with **Pydantic** for data validation and **Motor for asynchronous MongoDB operations**. Designed with OAuth2 authentication, this application ensures secure access while maintaining high performance and flexibility.

Key Features
- **FastAPI Framework:** Utilizing FastAPI, the app achieves high performance and offers automatic generation of interactive API documentation via Swagger and ReDoc.

- **Pydantic for Data Validation**: Pydantic models are employed for data validation and serialization, ensuring that incoming and outgoing data adheres to defined schemas.

- **Asynchronous MongoDB with Motor:** The app employs Motor, an asynchronous driver for MongoDB, allowing for non-blocking database interactions which improves performance under load.

- **Authentication and Authorization:** The app implements OAuth2 with password flow using FastAPI's OAuth2PasswordBearer, ensuring secure user authentication.

Project Structure
- **API Endpoints:** The application features endpoints for user signup, login, and secured access to resources.
- **Pydantic Models:** Data schemas for user registration and authentication are defined using Pydantic.
- **Database Operations:** Async CRUD operations are performed using Motor for seamless MongoDB interactions.

Also, with this application, you can:

üåê Build blazing-fast APIs and services with minimal effort.

üóÑÔ∏è Leverage the power of MongoDB for handling your data storage, offering flexibility, performance, and scalability.

üê≥ Run the entire app stack seamlessly using Docker and Docker Compose, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about complex installations.
